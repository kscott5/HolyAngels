    <b>THE HOLY ANGELS CHURCH MURAL</b></h3>
<p align="left">
    The mural was painted by <a href="http://www.holyangels.com/Martyrs-for-Humanity.htm"
        name="Fr. Englebert Mveng"><b>Fr. Englebert Mveng</b>,</a> a priest from Cameroon,
    Africa, especially for Holy Angels Church. The February 1989 issue of <u>Time</u>
    magazine published a two page article on the resurgence of his work in the Catholic
    Church in Africa. However, on the night of April 22-23, 1995 an unknown assailant
    (s) brutally murdered the <a href="http://www.holyangels.com/Martyrs-for-Humanity.htm">
        <b>Reverend Englebert Mveng</b>,</a> a Jesuit priest, author, artist, and prominent
    Cameroonian historian, in his residence outside of Yaounde. The murder, in 1995,
    was only the most recent of several unsolved murders of clergy over the past several
    years. The police announced an investigation into the case, but at the end of 1995,
    no progress had been reported. Father Mveng's murder remains unsolved. The Government
    was widely criticized for not seriously pursuing an investigation into this and
    other church murders, leading to widespread speculation about government complicity.&nbsp;
    The mural depicts the roles and interventions that Angels have played throughout
    the history of mankind.

    <b>1.From Revelations: (Warriors and fighters) </b>
</p>
<p>
    St. Michael the Archangel is shown as he thrusts his sword into the mouth of the
    Serpent-Dragon, Satan (in Hebrew this means accuser) casting him down from heaven.
    The serpent&nbsp;&nbsp; was protesting God sending him onto earth in the form of
    man. This is in contrast to the multitude of Angels who sang and celebrated his
    birth to Mary and Joseph.</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;<b>2. Book of Daniel: (Deliverers) </b>
</p>
<p>
    Three Jewish men, Hanaiah, Azarich, and Mishael, renamed Meshak Shadrak and Abednego,
    by sthe Chaldeans, as they were thrown into the fire by King Nebuchadnezzar. They
    prayed for deliverance and the Lord sent to them an angel who appears as the yellow
    figure with outstretched hands to protect them from the fire.</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;<b>3. Acts of the Apostles: (Ch.6 ) (Liberators) </b>
</p>
<p>
    Peter was banished to prison by King Herod and the Lord sent an angel in the middle
    of the night to who told him to get up and as he did his shackles broke and he walked
    past the sleeping guards. The artist thought that in light of Nelson Mandela's recent
    release from Prison, he would make the face on Peter closely resemble Mandela's
    (which it does).</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;<b>4. The Annunication</b><b>: (Preparers of the Way) </b>
</p>
</p>
<p>
    The Virgin Mary appears as a common Nigerian woman in her village hut preparing
    her FU FU (evening meal), when the archangel Gabriel appears to her and says "Hail
    Mary, full of grace the Lord is with thee", letting her know that she is about to
    conceive Christ. The Holy Spirit descends, indicating the presence of the Lord.<p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <b>5. Resurrection and Ascension: (Announcers of the Good News) </b>
</p>
<p>
    On Easter morning the angels appeared to announce the good news of his resurrection
    and Ascension into heaven. The tomb is Christ's feet indicating his victory over
    death, and the shroud within which he was wrapped is under his right hand. The left
    hand is held out to show the wound for 'doubting Thomas'.</p>
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;<b>6. Agony in the Garden: (Comforters and Consolers) </b>
</p>
<p>
    The apostles slept as Christ prayed and agonized over the burdens of mankind. The
    Chalice represents that portion of the Biblical verse that says "take this cup from
    me but if it be thine will I will drink it." Of course the angels appeared to comfort
    and console him.</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;<b>7. Book of Revelation: (Protectors) </b>
</p>
<p>
    On Judgment day four angels appeared and they went to the four corners of the earth
    and as they grabbed the winds to let them blow and destroy the entire earth a fifth
    angel appeared, held out his hand and said certain of those have been sealed with
    the sign of Christ and they shall be saved.</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;<b>8. Genesis: (Messengers) </b>
</p>
<p>
    We are told that Abraham was asleep outside of his tent in the village of Mamre
    when awakened to find three travelers approaching. Abraham and Sarah were both in
    their nineties and always wanted to bear children. These travelers were in fact
    messengers to bring the good news that Abraham and Sarah were to bear a child whom
    they would name Isaac. Abraham brought them bread and put them up for the night.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;<b>9. Book of Tobit: (Healers) </b>
</p>
<p>
    One of the apocryphal books. Tobit was blind and the archangel Raphael appeared
    to his son and his wife and instructed them to take the gall from a fish and place
    over Tobias' eyes. When he did so scales dropped from his eyes and he was able to
    see again.</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;<b>10. Star of Bethlehem at the Birth of Jesus: </b>
</p>
<p>
    Brightly shining its light upon the faces of 49 angels. You can the brightness of
    the light reflected on the faces as it descends. "And there appeared a multitude
    of angels singing and celebrating the birth of Christ. II There are 49 faces indicative
    of the biblical verse that says <i>"you shall forgive and love 7 x 7</i>.”&nbsp;
    The infant Jesus appears wrapped in common loin cloth in common surroundings of
    the average family of the day.<p>

    &nbsp;Usually after the explanation you go back around counter-clock wise to pronounce
    the one.</p>
